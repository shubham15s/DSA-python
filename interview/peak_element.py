Question: A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors. Given an input array nums, where nums[i] â‰  nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index. The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case, return the index to any one of the peaks.
Example Input: [1, 2, 3, 1]
Example Output: 2 (3 is a peak element)

    while left < right:

        if nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]:
            left = mid + 1 
        else:
